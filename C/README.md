This loader in C has a very simple inject chain (modified version of the Lazarus chain), but showcases a number of techniques that can help give you a lower profile. When built with the release profile (check build.py), it will have no entries in the IAT, CRT independence, and no suspicious strings. This loader uses runtime linking and HellHall for syscalls.

Additionally, I noticed substantially improved results when adding some "content" to reduce entropy. So, as a post-processing step, I cat the payload with "important.jpg", which moves it to not even getting a suspicous score. I don't know why AVs still value entropy so much, since I had this experience before by evading CrowdStrike Falcon by inserting the U.S. constitution into the .data section. Regardless, it's a "feature" we can abuse thanks to our new AI/ML saviors that are going to take all of our cyber jobs /s

As with the C# project, ##DO NOT BUILD MANUALLY##. Use the scripts/build.py to build the binary. This is because I had to do a custom scuffed preprocessor macro to obfuscate some of the function delegate names at compile time. There's probably a more clever solution to be had, but GCC doesn't support constexpr, so we get this I guess.
